# Bdello_Cycle

Contents of the repository:

* MFA: scripts used to extract information on ORI-TER ratio from the Hi-C sequencing data. This script plots the binned DNA coverage along the chromosome.
* RNA sequencing analysis: scripts that visualize the RNA sequencing results obtained by T-Rex (http://trex3.molgenrug.nl). This folder also contains the methods used by Novagen to calculate the relative normalized gene expression of each gene.
* NC_figure 1: contains the misic workflow (misic_bdello.pyndb) and the .Rmd files used to analyze the data obtained from misic & microbeJ to calculate the N/C ratios depicted in figure 1.
* antibiotics: contains the datasets & .Rmd file to analyze these datasets to visualize the nucleoids and measure the cells & nucleoids of Bdellovibrio exposed to rifampicin & chloramphenicol (and control).
* proteome_analysis: code used to correlate the proteome data from Hocher et al, Nature Microbology 2021 with the RNA sequencing data of each gene at each time point
